# Airspace Manager — Feature Plan

> A dedicated nav-rail panel (**directly under Radar**) + a backend aeronautical-data subsystem over
> **OpenAIP**: airspaces, obstacles, RC/model airfields and airports as toggleable map (2D) and globe (3D)
> layers. The **static counterpart to the Radar subsystem**. Architecture in ADR-038.
>
> **Status — P1 shipped (2026-06-08):** backend `aero/` (verified OpenAIP schema, per-layer radii, RAM
> region cache, 3 commands) · Data settings (toggle + provider + key) · the Airspace Manager panel
> (`advanced`: per-layer 2D/3D visibility + cache readout/clear; grouped nearby list with click-to-centre)
> · **2D rendering** (class-coloured polygons + typed markers incl. the wind-turbine icon) · **zoom-density
> management**.
>
> **Open (P2, next):**
> - **Centre fallback bug** — the fetch only follows the UAV position; it does **not** fall back to the GCS
>   marker / map centre when no UAV is connected. Fix the `radarReference ?? map.centre` path in `+page`.
> - **3D rendering** — the per-layer **3D toggles exist but don't render yet**: airspace extruded volumes
>   (with the relevance filter), obstacle columns, RC/airport ground projection.
> - **Density fine-tuning** — calibrate the min-zoom thresholds (`helpers/airspaceStyle.ts`) against the
>   OpenAIP map; possibly tie the obstacle/airport fetch radius to zoom too.
> - **Polish** — a class/type legend; nearby-list search + the `info` minimized panel variant.

## Mental model: the static counterpart to Radar
Same shape as the Radar subsystem, but for **static aeronautical features** instead of moving vehicles:
backend provider + region cache · a dedicated panel · 2D + 3D rendering · per-layer config. Updates only on
region change (data is static → long TTL).

## Data layers (OpenAIP) — scope locked to four

| Layer | 2D | 3D | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Airspaces** | **all** shown (when on) | **only relevant** ones | 3D relevance filter (below) — avoids clutter + cost |
| **Obstacles** (wind turbines, masts, towers, cranes) | small type-icon (height-labelled) | **vertical column** ground→height (start simple) | ⭐ critical for low flight; icon mapped from OpenAIP `type` |
| **RC / model airfields** | marker | **ground-projected highlight** | community-relevant |
| **Airports** (typed) | marker | **ground-projected highlight** | avoid / situational |

_Navaids, hotspots, reporting points: **out of scope** (not needed)._

### Airspace 3D relevance filter
2D shows **all** airspaces (when the layer is on). 3D shows an airspace **only if it's relevant to the UAV**:
- a boundary within **500 m above** the UAV's altitude, **or**
- within **5000 m laterally** of the UAV, **or**
- the UAV is **inside** it.

Everything else is hidden in 3D as irrelevant. (Reference = the UAV; falls back to the GCS/camera when no UAV.)

## Density management (zoom-based)

Without filtering, a region holds far too many features to draw at once (thousands of obstacles, every
small airfield + every gliding sector). Like the OpenAIP map, each feature has a **minimum 2D zoom** at
which it appears — by **importance/size** — so zoomed out you see only the big/important things and detail
fills in as you zoom in. Re-evaluated on every zoom/pan (`moveend`). The thresholds are tunable
(`helpers/airspaceStyle.ts`) and meant to be calibrated against the OpenAIP map's behaviour.

Leaflet zoom reference: ~2 world · 6 country · 8 region · **11 area** · 13 local · 15 street.

| Layer | Min-zoom rule |
|---|---|
| **Airspaces** | by OpenAIP `type` tier: FIR/UIR ≥6 · **Tier A ≥7** (Prohibited/Restricted/Danger/CTR/TMA/CTA/ADIZ/MCTR) · **Tier B ≥9** (RMZ/TMZ/ATZ/MATZ/Alert/Warning/Protected/TIZ/TIA/MTA) · **Tier C ≥11** (gliding/sporting/VFR-FIS sectors/airways/…) |
| **Airports** | by type/size: International ≥6 · Airport/IFR/Mil-aerodrome ≥8 · Airfield/Heliport ≥9 · glider/ultralight/water/strips/altiport/closed ≥11 |
| **RC / model airfields** | ≥12 (close only) |
| **Obstacles** | ≥12 (tall ≥150 m → ≥10, shown a bit earlier) |

Point layers are additionally **clipped to the visible bounds** and capped (1500/redraw) as a safety net.
The panel's nearby list is **not** zoom-filtered (it's a browser of the nearest features). **3D** will use
the equivalent camera-altitude thresholds (P2).

## Panel — "Airspace Manager" (nav rail, under Radar, `PanelShell` **`advanced`** variant, two-column)
The `advanced` (left controls + right data) variant is chosen specifically because the right column is a
**grouped nearby-feature list** — exactly like the Radar panel's three system groups.
- **Left = settings/controls:**
  - **Cache capacity readout + reset.**
  - **Per-layer visibility — separate 2D and 3D toggles** for each of the four layers ("what's visible in 2D
    / in 3D"). This replaces a single master mode.
  - Per-layer filters as needed (e.g. obstacle min-height, airspace classes, airport types).
  - **Alerts per relevant type** (airspace-level alert, obstacle alert) — **config space reserved; built
    later once the layers run.**
  - Whatever else settings-wise comes up.
- **Right = nearby-feature list, grouped per layer** — **Obstacles · Airspaces · Airfields** (RC + airports),
  distance-sorted within each group and **capped by count** (limit TBD), with the relevant info per entry
  (e.g. obstacle height, airspace floor/ceiling, field type) + the class/type **legend**. Click an entry →
  centre the map + highlight. Mirrors the Radar contact list (per-system groups). _Later this can also be
  presented as an `info` minimized card (like the logbook), so the variant stays multi-format._

## Settings (main app, Data tab — under the Cesium Ion token)
Kept minimal, like Radar / Flight Logbook:
- **Global feature toggle** — enables the subsystem + shows the panel in the nav rail.
- **Provider dropdown** (None / OpenAIP / future) — one active provider at a time.
- **API key** (shown only when the provider needs one, persisted).

Everything else (cache, per-layer 2D/3D visibility, filters, alerts) lives **in the panel**.

## Data source — single pluggable provider, OpenAIP first
A backend `AeroProvider` trait; **OpenAIP** first (`api.core.openaip.net`, `apiKey` query param, free
**non-commercial → user-supplied key**, licence obligation on the user). FAA (US, public domain),
openFlightMaps, national open-data are future impls behind the same trait. One active provider only (ADR-038).

## Architecture

### Backend — `src-tauri/src/aero/`
- **`AeroProvider` trait**: `fetch(center, radius_km, layers, api_key) -> AeroData`. `OpenAipProvider`: per
  enabled layer hit the matching endpoint (`/api/airspaces`, `/api/obstacles`, `/api/airports`, RC airfields)
  for the region (`pos=lat,lon&dist=` or `bbox`), paginate, map into normalized models.
- **Normalized models**:
  - `Airspace` — `name`, `class`, `lower`/`upper` `{value_m, datum: Gnd|Msl|Std}`, `polygon: Vec<[lon,lat]>`.
  - `PointFeature` — `kind` (obstacle/airport/rc), `subtype` (→ icon), `name`, `lat`, `lon`,
    `elevation_m?`, `height_m?` (obstacles → 3D column height), `lighting?`.
  Units/datum normalized to metres in the backend.
- **Cache**: last fetched region (~**500 km radius** around the reference) in RAM, long TTL. Refetch only on
  reference move beyond a fraction of the radius, manual clear, or provider/key/layer change. Commands:
  `aero_fetch(center, radiusKm, layers)`, `aero_cache_stats()`, `aero_cache_clear()`.
- Attribution string per provider ("© OpenAIP contributors").

### Frontend
- **Stores**: normalized `aeroData` + `aeroCacheStats` + the panel's per-layer 2D/3D visibility config.
- **Fetch trigger**: when the feature is enabled and a provider (+ key) is set — debounced on the reference
  moving. Stops when disabled.
- **2D (Leaflet)**: airspace polygons (class-coloured, dashed for R/D/P) + category markers (obstacle /
  airport / RC) with a small SVG icon per `subtype`; click → info; a **legend**.
- **3D (Cesium)**: airspace **extruded volumes** for the **relevant** set only (datum: GND→terrain,
  MSL→geoid, FL/STD→pragmatic MSL); **obstacle columns** (ground→height); **ground-projected** highlights for
  RC/airports; billboards. View-cull + count cap.
- **Icons**: a small flat-SVG set mapped from OpenAIP `type`/`subtype` (per obstacle/airport kind),
  optionally seeded from OpenAIP's open icon set (licence permitting) — shared 2D/3D + legend.

## Phasing
- **P1 — foundation + the four layers in 2D + the panel.** Backend `aero/` (provider + OpenAIP + region
  cache + 3 commands) · Data settings (global toggle + provider + key) · the **Airspace Manager panel**
  (`advanced`: left = per-layer 2D/3D visibility + cache readout/reset; right = the **grouped nearby list**,
  basic) · **2D** rendering for the four layers + icon set + legend.
- **P2 — 3D + list polish.** 3D volumes (with the airspace relevance filter) + obstacle columns + RC/airport
  ground projection; nearby-list search + click-to-centre/info + the `info` minimized variant.
- **P3 — alerts + polish.** Per-type alerts (airspace-level, obstacle proximity), more filters, more
  providers (FAA / open-data), OpenAIP raster chart as an optional tile overlay.

## Verified OpenAIP schema (resolved in P1 against a live key)
- Endpoints `/api/{airspaces,obstacles,airports,rc-airfields}`; auth `?apiKey=`; spatial `pos=lat,lon&dist=m`;
  pagination `page`/`limit` (envelope `{limit,totalCount,totalPages,nextPage,page,items}`).
- **Units** 0=m · 1=ft · 6=FL · **referenceDatum** 0=GND · 1=MSL · 2=STD (`to_meters`/`alt_label` in `aero/mod.rs`).
- **Airspace** `type` 0–36 (4=CTR, 7=TMA, 1/2/3=Restricted/Danger/Prohibited…), `icaoClass` 0–6=A–G / 8=SUA,
  geometry Polygon/MultiPolygon, `lowerLimit`/`upperLimit {value,unit,referenceDatum}`.
- **Obstacle** Point + `type` 0=Obstacle/1=Chimney/2=Building/**3=Wind Turbine**/4=Tower, `elevation` (MSL),
  **`height` (AGL → 3D column)**.
- **Airport** `type` 0–13 (1=Glider, 3=Intl, 6=Ultralight, 7=Heliport…). **RC-airfield**: no type, has
  `permittedAltitude`/`operator`/propulsion flags.
- FL/STD altitudes treated pragmatically as MSL for display (P1).
