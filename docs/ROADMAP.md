# INAV GCS — Feature Roadmap

This document tracks planned features, organized by milestone.

## Legend
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [x] Completed

## ✅ Milestone 1: Foundation (v0.1.x)

- [x] Project setup (Tauri + Svelte + TypeScript)
- [x] Modular code structure (Rust backend + Svelte frontend)
- [x] MSP v1/v2 protocol codec (encode/decode)
- [x] MSP streaming parser (byte-by-byte state machine)
- [x] Serial port listing and selection UI
- [x] Serial port connection/disconnection
- [x] Basic MSP handshake (API_VERSION, FC_VARIANT, FC_VERSION, BOARD_INFO)
- [x] INAV version parsing & minimum version check (≥ 7.0)
- [x] Version-dependent feature gating system
- [x] FC info panel with feature availability display
- [x] Connection status display in toolbar
- [x] Leaflet map integration with OSM tile layer
- [x] Build scripts (Windows, Linux)
- [x] Development documentation
- [x] Session persistence (port, baud rate, map position/zoom, panel state)
- [x] Floating navigation panel with hamburger menu
- [x] Tab-based panel system (UAV Info, Settings, Mission Control)
- [x] Bottom telemetry overlay strip (placeholder widgets)
- [x] Map zoom controls repositioned (top-right)

## ✅ Milestone 2: Basic Monitoring (v0.2.x)

### MSP Scheduler & Transport
- [x] MSP scheduler (dedicated thread, owns SerialConnection after handshake)
- [x] Priority-based request queue (telemetry slots + command/bulk channels)
- [x] Request-Response flow control (next request only after reply/timeout)
- [x] Adaptive polling with priority-based degradation (no link type detection needed)

### Telemetry Polling
- [x] Attitude group: `MSP_ATTITUDE` — configurable 1–5 Hz (default 5)
- [x] Analog group: `MSPV2_INAV_ANALOG` — fixed 1 Hz
- [x] Position primary: `MSP_RAW_GPS` — configurable 1–5 Hz (default 2)
- [x] Position secondary: `MSP_ALTITUDE` — staggered rotation at position rate
- [x] Airspeed module: `MSPV2_INAV_AIR_SPEED` — optional, toggleable (default off)
- [x] Status group: `MSPV2_INAV_STATUS` — fixed 1 Hz
- [x] Telemetry data pushed via Tauri events to frontend

### Adaptive Degradation
- [x] Priority-based slot selection: when overloaded, high-priority groups polled first
- [x] Degradation order: PositionSecondary → PositionPrimary → Analog → Status → Attitude
- [x] Natural rate reduction: polls at configured rate as long as link sustains it

### Frontend Display
- [x] Live telemetry strip (ALT, SPD, VARIO, BAT, SATS) with real data
- [x] Aircraft position on map (GPS marker with heading arrow)
- [x] Battery voltage/current display
- [x] Arming status indicator (pulsing ARMED widget + status bar)
- [x] GPS satellite count and fix type (sensor bar + telemetry strip)
- [x] Sensor bar live indicators (GYRO, ACC, MAG, BARO, GPS)

### MSP Data Correctness (Bug Fixes)
- [x] Fix MSPV2_INAV_ANALOG decode (correct byte offsets for voltage, current, power)
- [x] Fix GPS fix type display mapping (0=NO GPS, 1=NO FIX, 2=2D, 3=3D)
- [x] Sensor bar driven by MSP_SENSOR_STATUS (151) hardware health instead of connection state
- [x] BARO status from actual sensor health (not altitude ≠ 0 heuristic)
- [x] GPS sensor warning state (yellow when sensor OK but no fix)
- [x] UAV platform type detection via MSP2_INAV_MIXER (0x2010) during handshake
- [x] Platform type display in UAV Info panel (Multirotor, Airplane, Helicopter, etc.)

### Dev Tools
- [x] MSP Debug Monitor panel (dev builds only, `import.meta.env.DEV` gated)
- [x] Per-message LED indicators (yellow=request, green=response, red=timeout)
- [x] MSG/s and bytes/s throughput counters (TX/RX)
- [x] Target rate vs actual rate per MSP code with throttle highlighting
- [x] POLL/INIT status badges (active polling vs handshake-only)
- [x] Zero-cost release build: `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` with no-op stub

### Settings
- [x] Attitude poll rate setting (1–5 Hz)
- [x] Position poll rate setting (1–5 Hz)
- [x] Airspeed module toggle (on/off)
- [x] Settings persisted in localStorage, passed to backend on connect

## Milestone 3: Enhanced Monitoring (v0.3.x)

- [ ] Flight path trail on map
- [ ] Multiple map tile providers (OSM, Satellite, Terrain)
- [ ] Compass / heading indicator widget

- [ ] Home position marker

## Milestone 4: Flight Recording & Logbook (v0.4.x)

- [ ] Flight recording engine (optional, toggled via settings)
- [ ] User-configurable database storage path (portable)
- [ ] Automatic per-flight telemetry recording (start on arm, stop on disarm)
- [ ] Flight logbook UI — list all recorded flights with metadata
- [ ] Individual flight telemetry replay on map
- [ ] Blackbox log import and attachment to flights
- [ ] Flight statistics & analysis (from Blackbox high-res data)
- [ ] Cloud sync support (optional, mobile-first)
- [ ] Export flight data (CSV, KML, GPX)

## Milestone 5: Mission Planning (v0.5.x)

- [ ] Waypoint placement on map
- [ ] Mission upload to FC (MSP WP commands)
- [ ] Mission download from FC
- [ ] Mission save/load (file)
