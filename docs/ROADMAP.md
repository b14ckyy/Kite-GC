- [ ] Populate `link_quality` from `uplinkLQ` (field already in DB schema v3)
- [ ] Add `uplink_snr_db` to `TelemetryRecord` + schema v4 migration
- [ ] Fall back to `MSPV2_INAV_ANALOG` RSSI for firmware < 9.1

### Multi-Protocol Architecture (see `docs/PROTOCOL_REFACTORING.md`)

**Phase 1 — ByteTransport trait extraction**:
- [x] `ByteTransport` trait (protocol-agnostic byte-level I/O: read/write/close)
- [x] `SerialByteTransport` — existing serial refactored to ByteTransport
- [x] `TcpByteTransport` — TCP client/server transport
- [x] `UdpByteTransport` — UDP transport (connectionless)
- [x] `MspTransport` — MSP framing layer over ByteTransport (replaces current `Transport` trait)
- [x] Refactor existing `MspScheduler` to use `MspTransport<ByteTransport>`

**Phase 2 — MAVLink integration**:
- [x] `mavlink` Rust crate with `common` + `ardupilotmega` dialects
- [x] `MavlinkHandler` — reader thread (continuous parse + dispatch) + heartbeat writer (1 Hz)
- [x] MAVLink → normalized payloads mapping (10 receive messages → same Tauri events)
- [x] GCS IDs: sysid=255, compid=190
- [x] ArduPilot + PX4 + INAV MAVLink firmware support

**Phase 3 — Protocol Selection & Connection Handling**:
- [x] Protocol selection: explicit UI dropdown (MSP / MAVLink), no auto-detect
- [x] Transport selection: Serial / TCP / UDP per protocol
- [x] Dual-protocol connection lifecycle in `commands/connection.rs` + `ActiveProtocol` state (no separate ConnectionManager module)

**Phase 4 — Raw Recording**:
- [x] MAVLink raw log: standard tlog format (`.tlog`) — full recording during flight + continuous mode
- [x] MSP: Pre-parsed telemetry text log (current `RawLogger`) written in parallel to DB as backup. Not the originally planned MWP v2 binary format.
- [x] Raw recording per protocol (different formats for MSP vs. MAVLink)
- [x] Crash-safe: raw files survive app crash during flight
- [x] Continuous raw logging: optional always-on recording from connect (pre-arm data included)
- [ ] True raw byte-level serial logger (`SerialLogger` / `RAWLogger`) for link debugging and secondary devices (ADSB, radar, etc.) — planned for later

**Phase 5 — ArduPilot Log Import**:
- [x] Native ArduPilot DataFlash `.bin` parser (self-describing FMT records)
- [x] Functional import of `.bin` files into the logbook (progress events, duplicate detection, armed segment logic, writes to `telemetry_records`)
- [x] Imported ArduPilot flights can be replayed normally through widgets + map
- [ ] ArduPilot `.tlog` MAVLink log import (recording works, import missing)
- [ ] ArduPilot mission import (MAVLink WP protocol) — open work item (temporary parallel implementation exists in frontend for ArduPilot missions)

### Future Protocols
- [ ] `LtmSource` — LTM (Lightweight Telemetry) passive frame parser

### Platform & UX Foundations

Cross-cutting groundwork items. Each carries non-trivial architectural or design weight — major considerations noted inline.

- [x] **Local terrain elevation provider (2D map & planning)** — implemented; see dedicated subsection below
  - _Decision_: **Copernicus DEM GLO-30** (free, no API key, AWS Open Data GeoTIFF). Chosen over SRTM/Terrarium: ~±4 m RMSE vs ~±9 m, global coverage incl. > 60°N (SRTM/Terrarium have none), and geoid-referenced (EGM2008 ≈ MSL) — matches our MSL waypoint/altitude pipeline with no geoid model needed. Terrarium PNG tiles were the elegant runner-up but are SRTM-grade globally.
  - _Major considerations_: point-sampling pipeline (fetch tile → decode → bilinear interpolate), region download for offline use, shared elevation abstraction for all four use cases below. Used **locally only** — for visualization/validation, independent of any onboard FC terrain (INAV 10 will add onboard SRTM1, irrelevant to us).
- [ ] **3D map (Cesium) stays as-is for now** — keep Cesium World Terrain; tile-resolution quirks and other 3D refinements tracked separately under Milestone 7.
- [ ] **Better map tile handling**
  - _Major considerations_: current IndexedDB LRU cache works but is reactive only. Consider region prefetch / offline area download, smarter eviction, retry/backoff on tile errors, optional vector tiles, and unified handling shared between Leaflet (2D) and Cesium (3D). Attribution + provider rate-limit compliance.
- [ ] **Global font-size multiplier setting**
  - _Major considerations_: app-wide scale variable (root `rem`/CSS custom property). Requires a UI dynamics pass — audit fixed-px layouts, panel/dock sizing, widget text (docks already px/vmin-based), and the CSS Grid zones (ADR-023) for reflow at large scales. Accessibility win. Persist in settings.
- [ ] **Improved in-app icons, graphics & app logo**
  - _Major considerations_: replace ad-hoc emoji glyphs with a consistent SVG icon set; proper app/installer/taskbar icons; light/dark variants; coherent branding. Bundle-size and licensing of any icon set.
- [ ] **Theming by connected UAV control system**
  - _Major considerations_: drive the accent color (currently fixed `#37a8db`) as a variable parameter from the detected FC/protocol (INAV / ArduPilot / PX4 / …). Needs the accent fully tokenized as a CSS custom property across all components, a mapping table per firmware, and persistence. Ties into the existing protocol-detection on connect.
- [ ] **Multi serial connections in background (aux devices)**
  - _Major considerations_: the MSP scheduler currently owns a single serial connection exclusively (ADR-007). An aux-device manager would run additional independent background connections (ADSB receiver, ESP-Radar, telemetry monitor, …) without disturbing the primary FC link — each with its own parser/handler, surfaced via an "Aux Devices" submenu. Data fusion onto the map (ADSB traffic, radar contacts). Builds on the ByteTransport abstraction (ADR-010) and the planned raw serial logger. Significant architecture item.

### Terrain Elevation (local DEM — 2D map & planning)

Source: **Copernicus DEM GLO-30** (geoid/EGM2008 ≈ MSL, no API key, offline-capable). Local use only — no dependency on onboard FC terrain. Shared elevation-sampling abstraction feeds all four features:

- [x] Elevation provider: Rust backend module, tile fetch → disk cache → GeoTIFF decode → bilinear sampling; `terrain_elevation` / `terrain_profile` commands (decode + I/O on `spawn_blocking`, loads coalesced)
  - [ ] _follow-up:_ COG partial reads (HTTP range requests) + region pre-download for offline / weak-hardware latency
- [x] **AGL waypoint planning** — `alt_mode` REL/AMSL/AGL on waypoints; editor toggle converts altitude via terrain + launch point; survey patterns support AGL; AGL resolved to AMSL on export (MSP/​.mission) — validated against INAV Configurator terrain analysis
- [x] **Launch/home reference** — auto-placed, draggable map marker + connector to first WP; persisted in `.mission` via mwp-compatible `<mwp home-x/home-y>` meta (round-trips, inter-app compatible)
- [ ] **Terrain clearance validation** — elevation profile along the planned mission with clearance check / warnings (next)
- [ ] **Live AGL widget** — in-flight above-ground-level from GPS MSL altitude minus terrain elevation at current position
- [ ] **LOS (line-of-sight) analysis** for waypoint missions — terrain occlusion / radio horizon along the route, à la MWPTools

### Code Health & Maintainability
- [ ] Rust module reorganization when `flightlog/` exceeds 20 files (parsers/, exporters/, models/) — _currently 12/20, not yet needed_
- [ ] `tauri-specta` for auto-generated TypeScript types from Rust structs (Rust↔TS type safety)

## [~] Milestone 7: CesiumJS 3D Map View (v0.7.x)

### Core 3D Infrastructure
- [x] CesiumJS integration (Apache 2.0) with custom Vite plugin
- [x] Custom Vite plugin (`cesiumPlugin()`): sirv middleware (dev) + fs.cpSync (build) for Cesium assets
- [x] 2D/3D view toggle button on map (persisted view mode)
- [x] Cesium Ion token setting for World Terrain data
- [x] Map provider sync: 3D view uses same tile provider as 2D (live switching)
- [x] IndexedDB tile cache integration (shared cache between 2D and 3D views)
- [x] Per-provider `cesiumMaxZoom` limits for 3D view (prevents gray placeholder tiles)
- [x] Tile error handling: failed tile requests silently handled, parent tiles remain visible
- [x] `requestRenderMode: true` for reduced GPU idle load

### Terrain & Altitude
- [x] Cesium World Terrain (requires Ion token, degrades to flat ellipsoid without)
- [x] Geoid undulation correction: GPS MSL → WGS84 ellipsoid height via `sampleTerrainMostDetailed`
- [x] Async terrain provider readiness: `waitForTerrain()` waits for World Terrain load via `terrainProviderChanged` event
- [x] Depth testing against terrain (`depthTestAgainstTerrain: true`)

### UAV Entity & Visualization
- [x] UAV entity: colored point + SVG arrow billboard + label (colored by flight mode)
- [x] Home position marker: green "H", `CLAMP_TO_GROUND` height reference
- [x] Live trail: `CallbackProperty` polyline with 1m minimum distance filter
- [x] Playback track: static polyline from `TelemetryRecord[]`
- [x] Playback marker: point + arrow billboard following scrubber position

### Chase Camera (Follow Mode)
- [x] Toggle button: "🎥 Follow" / "👁 Free" (z-index 10000, always visible)
- [x] Smooth camera interpolation via `requestAnimationFrame` lerp loop
- [x] Exponential smoothing for position (lat, lon, alt) and heading
- [x] Shortest-path angle interpolation (handles 359°→1° wrap correctly)
- [x] Configurable range slider (50–2000 m) and pitch slider (-90° to -5°)
- [x] Works with both live telemetry and playback marker
- [x] Initial snap (no lerp from origin), smooth transitions thereafter

### Performance
- [x] Fog enabled (`density: 2.5e-4`) to hide distant terrain
- [x] Tile cache size limit (`tileCacheSize: 100`)
- [x] `scene3DOnly: true` (no 2D/Columbus mode overhead)
- [x] MSAA 2× anti-aliasing

### Planned (3D Map)
- [ ] 3D GLTF UAV models with attitude representation (roll/pitch/yaw)
- [x] Flight mode coloring of 3D track segments (Map3D — see Milestone 5b colored tracks)
- [ ] Smoothed flight track (polyline simplification or spline interpolation)
- [ ] UI button refinements and responsive layout
- [ ] Altitude exaggeration toggle for low-altitude flights
- [ ] Auto-enable chase camera on live flight start
- [ ] Imagery tile resolution / LOD quirks (blurry or low-detail tiles at certain zooms)
- [ ] More reliable 3D rendering: robust geoid-undulation handling (currently a single-point sample per track), terrain-load race conditions, provider quality review
- [ ] Evaluate whether Cesium World Terrain provider quality is sufficient or needs an alternative
